Welcome to Big Munchin'! The game designed to teach portion control and promote healthy eating habits.

The player has just moved to O.B. City from Celery Town, the health food capital of the nation. Having heard about the health problems of O.B. City, the player opens up a new health food store in the city. Their goal is to promote healthy eating habits and nutrition in the city. There is one problem though, Big Boss Glut Tony, the owner of the myriad of unhealthy restaurants in the city, doesn’t take kindly to the players' efforts and attempts to threaten them. The player must undermine Tony’s organization in their crusade to help the city.

With an intricate combat system, as well as minigames to portion out and prepare food for the restaurant, players have the opportunity to learn about healthier eating without getting bored. In addition, more locations will be added in future updates for players to explore. Those interested can find any updates, as well as the game in its current state, on this site.

Bon Appetit!
